## Introduction

Socket.IO is a real-time, bidirectional communication library that makes it easy to establish a connection between clients and servers. It allows you to build interactive and dynamic web applications, games, and chat applications with ease.

## Installation

To use Socket.IO in your project, you need to install it. Here's how to do it:

```bash
npm install socket.io
```

Alternatively, for the client-side code (if you're using a web application), include the Socket.IO client library in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To use Socket.IO in your project, you must first create a server and handle client connections. Here's a basic example of how to get started:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A user connected');

  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    io.emit('chat message', msg); // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

This is a simple example of a chat application. Clients can connect to the server and exchange messages in real-time.
