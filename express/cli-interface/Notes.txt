You can use Dynamic Input in Node Js :-
****************************************
In c language we have scanf function to accept input from user.
In Java language we have Scanner Class to accept Input from user. (System.in)
In Python we have input() function accept in input.

similarly, we can use cli interface or user to accept the code from html pages using Node Js.

Two ways to accept the Dynamic Input:-
***************************************
client : cli => Known
client : web => Known

How to accept input from command Line :-
we have two package:-
1. readline() package standard.
2. inquirer package.

readline : package is standard package for accept inputs.

step-1 : require readline package
        const readline = require('readline')

step-2 : createInterface for the command Line
        1. Input 
        2. output

process.env => standard Environment Variable.
process.env => standard input.
process.stdout => standard Output.

readline.createInterface({
    input : process.stdin,
    output : process.stdout,
});

readline.question("Enter Your Product Name:",(name)=>{
    console.log('Your name is '+ name);
    readline.close();
});
